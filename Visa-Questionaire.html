            <h3>Key Tips for Yashwanth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You should "keep answers short and clear", not over-explain.</li>
                <li>Stress your "PG coaching in India" as a strong tie (shows you are returning back).</li>
                <li>Avoid any mention of wanting to "explore opportunities in the US" — that can raise red flags.</li>
                <li>Carry proof of coaching enrollment and MBBS certificate, just in case.</li>
            </ul>
